# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive web-based tool that visually demonstrates various sorting algorithms. It helps users understand the step-by-step execution of sorting techniques through animations.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎨 **Interactive UI** – Adjust array size and animation speed with sliders.
- 🔊 **Sound Effects** – Toggle sound effects for a more immersive experience.
- 🔄 **Multiple Sorting Algorithms** – Supports:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort
- 📊 **Algorithm Complexity Details** – Displays time and space complexity for each algorithm.
- 🔄 **Random Array Generation** – Generate a new array at any time for visualization.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Structure of the visualizer
- **CSS** – Styling and animations
- **JavaScript** – Sorting logic and DOM manipulation

## 📦 Installation & Setup
